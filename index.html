                            Last year, for my robotics team, I began learning csockets and networking so we could send information for processes such as vision and data plotting between computers.
                            I wrote a system of classes that wrapped lower-level csocket functionality; this system allowed us to achieve what we wanted at the time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, I recently began overhauling the system with knowledge I have gained over the past year because the previous system was overly specific and not able to be used for anything else but for the tailor-made programs.
                            This overhaul is far more modular and will allow all the functionality of the previous system while not restricting the functionality.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            This is a javascript version of Falling Blocks, a game I first programmed 2 years ago in Java when I was in 9th grade. 
                            The original can be found <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/neelayjunnarkar/Game_FallingBlocks'>here on Github</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The objective of this game is to dodge blocks that are falling--hence the name.
                        </p>

                            Only a day since the last post but I suppose I'm only uploading pictures right now so it doesn't really count as anything new.

                            Well, if you didn't guess from the previous sentence, I just posted a bunch of <a href="/artwork/">pictures</a>.
                            Two of them, the porridge-related ones, I made a long time (3 years) ago.
                            The other 2 I made this year: The Ocean Waves during the early part and The Tree during the beginning of Summer.

                            So, it has been a long time since I posted anything on the blog. Over a year since my last post...the first post on this site.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Well, now I have finally modified this website. I decided to learn javascript a few days ago because I was going to make the multiplayer card game BS Poker (Bait).
                            However, it turns out I cannot run serverside code on Github pages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Oh well, but I am still continuing to learn javascript.
                            Today, I uploaded my first programs in javascript...Head over to <a href='/programs/'>Programs</a> to check them out!
