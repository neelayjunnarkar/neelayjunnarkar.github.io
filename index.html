          This is a javascript version of Falling Blocks, a game I first programmed 2 years ago in Java when I was in 9th grade. The original can be found <a href='https://github.com/neelayjunnarkar/Game_FallingBlocks'>here on Github</a>
          <br>The object of this game is to dodge blocks that are falling--hence the name.

          Only a day since the last post but I suppose I'm only uploading pictures right now so it doesn't really count as anything new.<br>
          Well, if you didn't guess from the previous sentence, I just posted a bunch of <a href = '/art'>pictures</a>.
          Two of them, the porridge-related ones, I made a long time (3 years) ago.
          The other 2 I made this year: The Ocean Waves during the early part and The Tree during the beginning of Summer.

          So, it has been a long time since I posted anything on the blog. Over a year since my last post...the first post on this site.<br>
          Well, now I have finally modified this website. I decided to learn javascript a few days ago because I was going to make the multiplayer card game BS Poker (Bait). <br>
          However, it turns out I cannot run serverside code on Github pages. Oh well, but I am still continuing to learn javascript.<br>
          Today, I uploaded my first programs in javascript...Head over to <a href = '/code'>Code</a> to check them out!
