                        <p>
                            I recently created a keyboard layout (using Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4) for Windows so that I could easily use non-english symbols. 
                            Primarily, I wanted to be able to type for my Spanish class without having to keep switching between the US English Keyboard and the Latin America Spanish Keyboard.
                            I also added mathematical symbols such as π, λ, θ, ∑, and equality comparison symbols.
                            Symbols are accessible using the alt-gr key.
                            Some of the locations of symbols are based on how macs place the symbols, but I changed much. For example, in my kebyoard, one types the   ́    (accent) after the letter instead of before.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To install this keyboard, go to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/neelayjunnarkar/KeyboardLayouts">this repository</a>, download the zip file ('njkeyboa.zip') in the repository, and run the setup exe.

                        <p>
                            Last year, for my robotics team, I began learning csockets and networking so we could send information for processes such as vision and data plotting between computers.
                            I wrote a system of classes that wrapped lower-level csocket functionality; this system allowed us to achieve what we wanted at the time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, I recently began overhauling the system with knowledge I have gained over the past year because the previous system was overly specific and not able to be used for anything else but for the tailor-made programs.
                            This overhaul is far more modular and will allow all the functionality of the previous system while not restricting the functionality.

                            So, it has been a long time since I posted anything on the blog. Over a year since my last post...the first post on this site.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Well, now I have finally modified this website. I decided to learn javascript a few days ago because I was going to make the multiplayer card game BS Poker (Bait).
                            However, it turns out I cannot run serverside code on Github pages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Oh well, but I am still continuing to learn javascript.
                            Today, I uploaded my first programs in javascript...Head over to <a href='/programs/'>Programs</a> to check them out!
