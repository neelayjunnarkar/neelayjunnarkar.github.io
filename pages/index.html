                So, if you were too lazy to read the below paragraphs, they essentially said:
                <articleHeader>
                    <br class = "articleNewLine"><br class = "articleNewLine">
                    "go click on that prions link."
                </articleHeader>
            </articleHeader>
            
            <div class = "article"></div>
            <br class = "articleNewLine">
            
            <articleHeader>Nevermind!</articleHeader>
            <div class = "article">
                Nevermind about most things I said below. <i>Most</i> things. This page shall now be the only place you can get to the prions page from. You can also get to someother pages from here. I <i>would</i> put that "However..." link back on the main page again but I think that might cause some slight unhappiness and angry adults.
                 
            </div>
            
            <articleHeader>Unwelcome!</articleHeader>
            <div class = "article">
                You're really not supposed to be here. In fact, I didn't want this page to exist. But I made it, in case anyone felt like coming here. Really all you'll be able to do here is redirect to pages <b>you could get to from the HOME PAGE. The HOME PAGE.</b> Heard of such a thing before? I thought not. Anyways, if you <i>really</i> want them, the links are in the sidebar to the left (or right, depending on which way it's floated). Actually, I'm only going to put the link to the home page 'cause yeah.
