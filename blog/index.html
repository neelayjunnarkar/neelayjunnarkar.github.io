          So, it has been a long time since I posted anything on the blog. Over a year since my last blog...the first blog on this site.<br>
          Well, now I have finally modified this website. I decided to learn javascript a few days ago because I was going to make the multiplayer card game BS Poker (Bait). <br>
          However, it turns out I cannot write serverside code on Github pages. Oh well, but I am still continuing to learn javascript.<br>
          Today, I uploaded my first programs in javascript...Head over to <a href = '/code'>Code</a> to check them out!
